# Playwright Expert

Write or debug E2E tests for: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Setup

- Dev server must be running: `npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000)
- Use `mcp__playwright__*` tools for browser interaction
- Tests go in `src/__tests__/e2e/` if writing to files

---

## Process

1. Navigate to the page under test
2. Take a snapshot to understand current DOM state
3. Identify interactive elements using role-based selectors
4. Write the test flow: navigate → interact → assert
5. Verify the flow passes in a clean browser state

---

## Selector Priority (highest to lowest)

```ts
// 1. Role-based (preferred)
page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Start Quiz' })
page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'World Explorer' })

// 2. Label / placeholder
page.getByLabel('Search countries')
page.getByPlaceholder('Search...')

// 3. Text content
page.getByText('Next question')

// 4. Test ID (when nothing else works)
page.getByTestId('flag-mosaic')

// Never: CSS classes, nth(), first() without justification
```

---

## Core Patterns

### Basic Flow
```ts
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Start Quiz' }).click();
await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Quiz Setup' })).toBeVisible();
```

### Waiting (use auto-waiting — never waitForTimeout)
```ts
// Good — waits for element to appear
await expect(page.getByText('Score:')).toBeVisible();

// Bad — arbitrary sleep
await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // ❌ never do this
```

### Assertions
```ts
await expect(page.getByRole('button')).toBeEnabled();
await expect(page.getByText('10/10')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page).toHaveURL('/results');
```

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- One user flow per test — keep tests focused
- Reset to clean state between tests (navigate to home)
- Use `expect().toBeVisible()` not `isVisible()` — auto-waits
- Take screenshots on failure for debugging

**Don't:**
- Share browser state between tests (login once, use everywhere) — causes flaky tests
- Use `nth()` or `first()` selectors — fragile
- Hardcode timeouts — trust Playwright's auto-wait
- Test implementation details — test what the user sees

## Key User Flows to Test in This Project

- Home page loads with flag mosaic
- Country search filters results
- Quiz setup (continent + question count selection)
- Quiz flow: question → answer → next
- Quiz completion and score display
- Dark/light theme toggle persists
- Navigation guard blocks leaving during active quiz
